        <p className="about">Hi, my name is Richard, and I'm a Software Engineer based in Greeley, Colorado. I currently serve as a Technical Support Engineer at ClickUp, applying a developer's mindset to production issues.</p>
        <p className="about">As a TSE, my focus is on deep-dive platform defect analysis and resolution. I architect and implement solutions for escalated client issues and build internal tooling to automate repetitive tasks, dramatically improving team efficiency.</p>
        <p className="about">My technical stack is centered on PostgreSQL for generating complex user reports and executing corrective, high-impact database queries. I leverage Python and JavaScript to develop robust scripting solutions that automate repetitive workflows. Angular and Typescript are also heavy areas of focus when resolving platform bugs.</p>
        <p className="about">I spearheaded a pivotal AI and LLM defect resolution pilot, successfully proving the efficacy of AI for bug fixes. This initiative has since scaled to include the entire Product and TSE teams. As a demonstration of its success, our 6-person TSE team now averages approximately 35 platform bug fixes weekly. I personally designed and led the upskilling session for the Product team on leveraging AI for improved efficiency.</p>
        <p className="about">My contributions include direct feature development, such as smart space removal for user mentions, Calendar view search, and doc sidebar auto-scroll. I currently maintain a focused learning plan, mastering new TypeScript and Angular features daily, and I am actively working through Microsoft Learnâ€™s 'AI Agents for Beginners' certification.</p>
        <p className="about">My background as a lifelong artist and former ex-pat gives me a unique perspective on user interaction and design empathy. This artistic eye, combined with my current experience as a TSE solving real-world user pain points, results in a well-rounded approach to development that always prioritizes the end-user experience. I look forward to continuing this growth trajectory and applying daily progress to impactful engineering challenges.</p>

    //             I was born in Seattle Washington, and grew up east of Colorado Springs in a small town named Peyton. I
    //             graduated from Falcon High School, and studied Business Management and Economics at Colorado Mesa
    //             University. At Mesa, I ran for the mens varsity cross country and T&F teams, participated as the
    //             director of membership for the Phi Beta Lambda business club, and spent a year as a Residence Hall
    //             Assistant. I graduated in 2014, and taught mathematics at Denver West Leadership Academy in 2015
    //             before working and eventually living in Southeast Asia for about 3 years. I met my wife in Siem Reap,
    //             Cambodia, and a year after our wedding in 2018, she immigrated with me back to the states. We now live
    //             and work in Loveland Colorado. We expect our first baby this summer! I've done a bit of independent
    //             coding study aside from this class.
